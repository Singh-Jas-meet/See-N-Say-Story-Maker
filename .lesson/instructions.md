# Instructions  

1. Watch the short video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG8y_e6t0G4
, and carefully watch how the user interacts with the toy.


2. Examine the JavaScript – note that by setting a string value to the variable, 
textToSpeak and clicking the button, the built-in TextToSpeech API will read 
the words aloud (in every browser except MSIE – but Edge is fine).

3. Edit the HTML file to include 5 buttons – each one will pick a random phrase from a 
JavaScript array (use the image on the last page of this assignment to build each of 
the five arrays). Note that the first column is a list of nouns (forming the sentence 
subject), the second is a list of verbs, the third is a list of adjectives, the fourth, another 
list of nouns, and the fifth consists of a number of places (or settings).

4. The user will push each of the buttons, and each will concatentate the random word 
from it’s array, eventually building the text string that will be assigned to the variable 
textToSpeak.

5. Create a sixth button that will actually pass the value to textToSpeak to the 
speakNow() function (this part of the assignment is already built for you).


6. Once you’ve completed the functionality of the interface, add some CSS to make 
the page visually attractive (don’t spend too much time on this – the focus is the JS).
7. Ensure that all your HTML, CSS, and JS is well-commented, formatted, and organized.
